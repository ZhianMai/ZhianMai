- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZhianMai, and go by <i>Johnston</i>. Contact me @ johnstonmai11@gmail.com
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in problem solving & Java-related skills like Spring Framework & Java multi-threading.
- All these challenges can make me excited: binary search, binary tree, DFS, DP, BST... you name it!
- My coding strictly follows Google Java style guide, SOLID principle, and concepts from <i>Effective Java</i>.

Check out the repos below as my sample coding works here :)

### Thread-safe Linked-list & Hash Map in Java   :link:[link](https://github.com/ZhianMai/Thread-safe-LinkedList-Hashmap)
@author Zhian Mai

Size: :star::star::star:

Complexity: :star::star::star:

Implementations of thread-safe linked-list & hash map using read-write lock, with multi-threaded testing.

Implementation Features:
  - Supports generic;
  - Supports Iterable<>;
  - Factory pattern to create hash map, based on thread-safe stragegy (no thread-safety, synchronized, and read-write lock);
  - Read-write lock provided by ReentrantReadWriteLock;
  - Multi-threaded testing guarantees no data racing on thread-safety data structure.
  - Java design rules from <i>Effective Java</i>.
  - And more on the way...
