- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZhianMai, and go by <i>Johnston</i>. Contact me @ johnstonmai11@gmail.com
- 👀 I’m interested in problem solving and Java-related skills like Spring Framework and Java multithreading.
- All these challenges can make me excited: binary search, binary tree, DFS, DP, BST... you name it!
- My coding strictly follows Google Java style guide, SOLID principle, concepts from <i>Effective Java</i>, and industry standard if appliable.

Check out the repos below as my sample coding works here :)

### Multithreading in Java (In progress)   :link:[link](https://github.com/ZhianMai/Multi-threading-in-Java)
@author Zhian Mai

Size: :star::star::star::star::star:

Complexity: :star::star:

A huge project! Detailed description & demo of multi-threading concepts, including thread creation, thread pool, thread life cycle, locking, concurrency, applications, and more.

### Thread-safe Linked-list & Hash Map in Java   :link:[link](https://github.com/ZhianMai/Thread-safe-LinkedList-Hashmap)
@author Zhian Mai

Size: :star::star::star:

Complexity: :star::star::star:

Implementations of thread-safe linked-list & hash map using read-write lock, with multi-threaded testing.

Highlights:
  - Supports generic;
  - Supports Iterable<>;
  - Factory pattern to create hash map, based on thread-safe stragegy (no thread-safety, synchronized, and read-write lock);
  - Read-write lock provided by ReentrantReadWriteLock;
  - Multi-threaded testing guarantees no data racing on thread-safety data structure.
  - Java design rules from <i>Effective Java</i>.
  - And more on the way...

@author AgileIntelligence & Zhian Mai

Size: :star::star::star::star:

Complexity: :star::star::star::star::star:

An online app that helps user to manage projects and their tasks.
- Frontend: React;
- Backend: Spring Framework (Boot, Security with JWT, JPA), MySQL.
